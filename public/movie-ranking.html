<p>This is my favourite movie. <br>I saw it in 1995, just before I went to Albania and it inspired me. <br>The scenery was about the same. Nowadays you can see a lot of improvement.</p>

<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Officer_and_a_Gentleman" target=“_blank”>An officer and a gentleman</a></h3>

<p>Unknowingly a student psychology took me to this movie in 1988.<br>In 1997 I found out I had autism as well.</p>
